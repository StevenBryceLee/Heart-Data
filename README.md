# Heart-Data
This project is to compete in the driven data competition here: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/54/machine-learning-with-a-heart/page/109/

This zip folder contains jupyter notebooks written in Python 3.6, with file extensions .ipynb

There are two files, one for cleaning and transforming the initially given .csv file, and another for creating a pipeline for searching for the ideal model

Support Vector Machines consistently ranked highest, with a log loss score of 0.37~

The General_train.ipynb file could be used for any classification project, so long as the initial data is cleaned
